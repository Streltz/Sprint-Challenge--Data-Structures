#  Sprint Challenge -- Data Structures
1. The order of insertions/removals for:
    * Stacks: Last in, First out
    * Queue : First in, First out

2. The retrieval time complexity for:
    * Linked List - O(n) - linear dataset
    * Hash Table - O(1) - Size of the dataset has no effect on retrieval since because each element has it's own set key.
    * Binary Search Trees - O(log(n)) - Logarithmic complexity.

3. Advantages of using a Hash Table over an array are:
    * For large data sets, times are faster
    * It is easier to retrieve the elements of a Hash Table because each value has it's own retrievable key.
